# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. import the needed packages.
2.Assigning hours to x and scores to y.
3.Plot the scatter plot.
4.Use mse,rmse,mae formula to find the values.




## Program And Output:
```
